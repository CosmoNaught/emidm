Both platforms allow you to combine code, visualisations, explanatory text, and equations in one document, enhancing clarity, reproducibility, and collaboration."

    "### What is a Notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "A notebook is a special file format (with a `.ipynb` extension) that stores not only the **code** but also the **outputs** of that code (such as plots, tables, and text), as well as any **markdown-formatted explanations**. Under the hood, it’s a JSON document that wraps code, output, and metadata in a structured format, often rendered as HTML when viewed in a browser (e.g. on GitHub). This allows you to view the outputs of a notebook—even without running the code—when it's shared online.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Run Order Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "One important aspect of working with notebooks is that cells can be executed in **any order**, and their outputs are stored until cleared or overwritten. This means a notebook can appear to \"work\" even when the code is run out of sequence or relies on prior cell execution that hasn’t happened in a fresh session. Always restart the kernel and run all cells in order to ensure reproducibility."
